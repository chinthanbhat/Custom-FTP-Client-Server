The project consisted of all the basic commands of FTP along with file upload and download. 
The server used was Amazon AWS EC2 cloud server. 
Multiple clients could connect to the server and process its needs. 
The implementation involved creating multiple threads and using locks, monitors and shared variables on these threads. 
This inclusion of concurrent programming brought efficiency and security to the file upload and download.
Server file hosted on AWS EC2. Hence remote access was possible to the server.
